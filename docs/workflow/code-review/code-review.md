# Code review
software developers check their code a lot; scientific data analysts and programmers can, too\!

<img style="center" src='../../files/review.png' width='85%' > 

## Process
* The code author documents the context and aims to write efficient, well-commented code that follows agreed-upon lab specifications to the best of their ability.   
* The code reviewer is ideally done with someone who did not write the code who  
  * verifies that the code works and produces the intended numbers  
  * provides feedback on elements including but not limited to the modularity, math and logic, and overall code (e.g., formatting, typos, comments, documentation)  
* The code author is responsible for implementing feedback

## Implementation
* Code review alongside the process (i.e., early\!) is more manageable and catches errors along the way.  
* Small chunks of code review (max 200 lines at a time) can prevent reviewer burnout.  
* Code review can be done synchronously in a face-to-face meeting with groups of varying sizes; it can also be done asynchronously. Either way, opportunities to ask questions can be helpful.  
* Software and AI may be helpful to an extent, especially for formatting consistency and errors.  
* A need to re-create environments may come up. (Link to resources: )  
* Culture matters. Sharing code can be vulnerable but will reduce errors and improve reproducibility. It is easier in a culture where perfection is not the expectation, but rather kindness.

## Example checklist

### For a code reviewer
- [ ] Functionality
    *Running the code generates the identical output
    * Code implements the intended functionality
- [ ] Readability
    * The code is easy to follow
    * The overall script is organized sensibly
    * Line by line, the code is logical and accurate
    * The code is formatted in agreed-upon ways (or is internally consistent).
    * The folder, file, variable names, and outputs are formatted in agreed-upon ways (or are internally consistent) and are names are sufficiently informative
- [ ] Code structure and design
    * The code is modular
    * There are no repetitive blocks of code
    * Functions and classes are reasonable size and complexity
- [ ] Error handling
    * Code includes proper potential error handling mechanisms
    * Logging is implemented for debugging and troubleshooting purposes
- [ ] Security
    * The authentication and authorization mechanisms should implement correctly
- [ ] Code reuse
    * Raw data files are not overwritten or altered in any way
    * Dependencies are managed correctly and up-to-date
- [ ] Testing and coverage
    - There are some unit test to check specific functionality
    - Do the tests consider potential edge cases?
- [ ] Documents
    * The script is included in the GitHub repository (if using)
    * There is a clear top-level description of the script’s purpose
    * Functions, methods, and classes have descriptive comments or strings
- [ ] Performance
    * Performance is efficient
    * Memory usage is optimized
    * Algorithms and data structures are efficient

#### After code review
- [ ] Code comply with coding standards and guidelines (Derived data) —> some formatting documentation for after code review
